Project - Where Am I

Before experimenting with the AMCL localization parameters, the robot localization particle diverges during the movement. But after some trial and error, the robot localization particle converges and I am able to get a stable localization.

There is still one issue I found, though. The robot does not able to avoid the obstacles right now and it sometimes starts rotating after finding the obstacle.
